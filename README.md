## Blocking the BBC News website Breaking News banner and Drumpfinating

The BBC News webiste has an annoying Breaking News popup. To block it simply add this entry to your hosts file:
```
0.0.0.0 polling.bbc.co.uk
```
There is a sample file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BreakingTheNews/BreakingTheNews.github.io/master/hosts).

If you also want to [Make Donald Drumpf Again](http://donaldjdrumpf.com/) then add this entry to your hosts file instead:
```
192.30.252.153 polling.bbc.co.uk
```
This will not only hide the Breaking News banner but will also replace every instance of the word Trump with the word Drumpf on the BBC News website.
